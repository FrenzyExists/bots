# bots
a script with a bunch of bots for different games from lagged.com

## How to run

The script uses hardcoded coordinates based on **MY** screen size, which means you will need to change said coordinates so it works for you. Also, I ran this with two windows; left is a terminal or Vscode and right is a browser.

## BOT 1: Piano Reflex Game

One of the easiest bots to make, uses `product` from `itertools` to speed up for loop.

## BOT 2: Piano Tiles

It was originally the one i first wanted to try out. This piano tiles game is the easiest of them all, as the normal piano tiles have a gradient color in its tiles and there are special tiles that you must hold for some time. And some versions even have a special tile that you hold and swipe across the screen. This version is NONE of that, its the most barebones of them all, and therefore the easiest to create a bot to play

## BOT 3: Rolling Ball Game

A pain to deal, somewhat inconsistent, sometimes it does terrible (around 69) and sometimes it surpases the global highscore 2 fold (around 132, once got 143)
